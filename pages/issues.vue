                <p>Counterfactuals are true statements which tend to imply that outcomes would be changed <em>if only</em> people had acted differently. They place a greater burden on the individuals involved, rather than the systemic nature of the underlying situation. Research demonstrates that the presence of counterfactual statements shifts blame toward the victim.</p>
                <p>Because car crashes are greatly influenced by systemic factors, such as road design, societal norms and expectations, planning, enforcement, etc., reducing and eliminating counterfactual statements is critical to getting past victim-blaming to achieve comprehensive safety.</p>
                <p>Counterfactual statements are a serious anti-pattern because they:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>obscure the systemic nature of crashes,</li>
                    <li>shift blame onto victims, and</li>
                    <li>absolve actors of irresponsible behavior</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Our system is designed to detect a number of counterfactual statements in the following categories:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li v-for="counter in counterfactuals" :key="counter">{{counter.name}}</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Counterfactuals typically correspond directly with the absence of thematic elements. The good news is that it's often easy to improve news reporting by observing these relationships:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Was the driver paying attention?</li>

While police are still investigating if the driver was focused and provided enough space while passing, nearby residents are sounding the alarm to unsafe road conditions. "So many tourists want to bike along this scenic waterfront route, but the local council for years has been dragging their feet on a bike lane!" says a local. The speed limit is 50 mph, fast enough to make death almost certain should a collision take place.

                                <ul>
                                    <li>Is the nearest crosswalk within reasonable walking distance?</li>

                                    <li>Have there been similar pedestrian-vehicle conflicts in the past? If so, has it led to change?</li>

                                A pedestrian was left seriously injured after attempting to cross the street. The pedestrian did not use a crosswalk. Satellite imagery suggests the nearest crosswalk was at least a quarter mile away &ndash; a 5 minute walk &ndash; in each direction. A number of pedestrian-vehicle crashes have taken place over the past year, calling into question the safety of a street home to many outdoor restaurants and boutique shops. We spoke with a local restaurant owner: "There's a bus stop across the street, but riders have to run across the street to get to our shop. I told the local bus authority months ago they need to move the bus stop to this side of the street."

                <p>As demonstrated, counterfactual statements obscure the underlying causes of crashes. Counterfactuals tend to preclude discussion about systemic factors and instead shift blame on individuals, including the victims. Statements insinuate a different outcome was possible if only individuals acted differently, and articles with counterfactual statements virtually never go into depth to discuss remediation.</p>

                </blockquote>
                <p>The tool marks usages of the word "accident" as problematic because the word accident implies a sense of faultlessness and unavoidability. Over 90% of car crashes are caused by human error, and virtually all causes of these crashes are known and avoidable, mostly by changing behavior and design.</p>
                <p>When crashes come down to a handful of causes &mdash; most commonly distracted driving, speeding, tailgating, alcohol and drug usage, and following too closely &mdash; we cannot conclude the causes are <em>unforeseen</em>, and while carelessness may be a factor, these are not matters of mere chance, fortune, or acts of God.</p>
                <p>We subscribe to the mentality that all accidents are crashes, but not all crashes are accidents; therefore, a higher burden of proof is required to use the word "accident". Some news agencies express worry that if they use the word crash, someone might file a libel/defamation suit saying the agency is blaming them for the incident. These fears are unwarranted and unrealistic, but there are other words that are recommended, in order of precedence:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>crash</li>
                    <li>collision</li>
                    <li>incident</li>
                    <li>accident</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There has been notable shift in sentiment toward the use of the word "crash":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Associated Press recommends avoiding the word "accident" if negligence is claimed or proven, as of 2016.</li>
                    <li>The NYPD no longer uses the word "accident" to describe car crashes, and has renamed its Accident Investigation Squad to the Collision Investigation Squad, as of 2013.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The tool is context-aware and does not punish uses of the word "accident" if it's part of a direct quotation or a proper noun, such as investigative bodies (e.g. the Boston Accident Reconstruction Unit).</p>
