          <p>Road design is perhaps the most important factor contributing to car crashes. Articles should mention relevant road design factors based on the circumstances. Look at the list below and incorporate a few relevant statements.</p><br />

                <td>Speed limits play a role in car crashes and are worth mentioning in the article. There is a direct correlation between vehicle speed and crash severity. Many speed limits are established via the 85-percentile rule, meaning the "appropriate" speed for a road is based on what 85% drivers perceive as safe, not what is safe for all road users.</td>

While residential roads may only consist of one lane each way, roads with more traffic may contain more lanes, including a median turn lane.

Wider lanes are known to make drivers feel safer, hence the faster speeds. Authors should draw attention to when residential lane widths are wider than highway lane widths.</td>

For example, some injuries and fatalities have occurred where people attempt to cross a road where the nearest crosswalk was unreasonably far away. Also consider nearby complementary facilities such as bus stops where departing riders may need to immediately cross the street.</td>

Local ordinances regarding riding a bicycle on a sidewalk may also be relevant.</td>
